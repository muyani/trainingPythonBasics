## Python 
Python is a general purpose,interactive,interpreted, object oriented programming created by a guy called Guido Van Rossum(in Netherlands) as a successor of ABC language.
#### 1. General purpose.
  - Can be used for backend web development.
  - Scientific Computing.
  - Artificial intelligence.
  - Data Analysis.
  - System Operations.
  - Server and administrative tools.
  - Deployment.
  - Scientific Modelling.
  - Desktop apps.
  - Games.
  - etc.
  #### 2. Interactive.
  Python offers an interactive shell to users
> The interactive shell is interactive in the way that it stands between the commands or actions and their execution. 
This means the Shell waits for commands from the user, which it executes and returns the result of the execution.
After this the shell waits for the next input.
  > A shell in biology is a calcium carbonate "wall" which protects snails or mussels from its environment or its enemies.
  Similarly, a shell in operating systems lies between the kernel of the operating system and the user. 
  It's a "protection" in both direction. 
  The user doesn't have to use the complicated basic functions of the OS but is capable of using simple and easier
  to understand shell commands. 
  The kernel is protected from unintended incorrect usages of system function.
  #### 3. Interpreted.
  An interpreted language is a language that is read in its raw form and executed statement at a time without being first compiled.
  #### 4. Object Oriented.
  Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. 
  Meaning, it supports different programming approach.
One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects.
This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. 
It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.



## What motivated me

Learning how to code is by far the most important personal investment someone can give his/her own self in this very 
century,effective coding skills is an incentive which African governments can use to realize their  "supposedly techno-centric" visions.
Edmond Mbiaka(I dont know who "tf" this is) once said:
  > “Take positive care of your mind, and it would surely take positive care of your life.” 
I have noticed an unnecessary lag students tend to go through while trying to learn code by themselves.
A skill-based education is one where, for example, you learn enough JavaScript to implement a feature. 
However, you do not understand the concepts used to do so. 




The result is that the knowledge does not generalize well, and it is difficult to adapt to new situations or programming languages. 
You often see this result in graduates from schools dedicated to a specific skill like game programming.
